Welcome to the "Build Your Own Shell" Challenge repository for Rust solutions!

## Overview

This repository serves as a my Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

## Getting started

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.70)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_shell.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
3. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
